# Linked Interdisciplinary Data Discovery (LIDD) Tool, July 12, 2015


## Intro

In the proposal, I said I would "create RDF translations...of DDI and
DataONE metadata records." After a discussion with one of my mentors,
Dave Dubin, and doing more research on the current state of
Linked Data (LD) technologies I'm ready to update that plan with
something that can better demonstrate the power of linked data in
interdisciplinary research projects. Briefly, this new plan will
harness Apache Jena to build linked data annotations of the original
metadata records with links back to the originals. I will develop a
REST API to deliver JSON-LD that will drive an Angular application. To
drive the specifics of this Linked Interdisciplinary Data tool, I'll
present some user stories which help us avoid getting bogged down in
details. User Stories help us determine the Who?, What?, and most
powerfully, Why? before determining the How?  

In answering the Who, What, Why, it will pay off to focus on User
Experience (UX) and Developer Experience (DE). At worst, it seems
W3C specifications and metadata-driven data repositories' specifications 
(e.g. [DataONE]() and [ICPSR]()) 

> itâ€™s just that the editor is bad at explaining them to non-implementers, 
> which are most of the web developers that end up reading these specification 
> documents

Again, this is no knock against the progress that has been made.
Amazing things are now possible. I just mean that it's important to
recognize that we are in a new phase of development. 
In short, there has not been enough attention given to the role of the
software developer or to modern web tools. Since

> your standard web developer has no interest in that toolchain because it 
> adds more complexity to the solution than is necessary.

A software developer's job is to deliver the maximum amount of quality
software. One of the [Twelve Principles of Agile
Software](http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html) is

> Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential.

So to ask them to learn and adopt a new database/querying tool (Jena [TDB]() 
and [Fuseki]()) and a data model that may or may not be compatible
with the web developer's favorite data serialization (JSON), and
figuring out if it's compatible and how involves reading [dense
documentation](http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/), is rather extreme.



### Choice of Software Toolkit

If we are serious about furthering the use of LD among software
developers who are developing applications for use in
interdisciplinary research, we need to build developer tools on the
latest and greatest software most popular among developers. Of course
popularity isn't the final say, but in many cases Darwinism works in
software ecology: the most suitable software typically has many questions
about it on Stack Overflow or the most forks on a GitHub repository
(reds flag if it doesn't have a GitHub repository, looking at you
DataONE). 



## User stories

The two data repositories we've decided to use as a proof of concept
is the ICPSR data repository, which provides DDI metadata to organize
its data, and the DataONE federated data repository that largely hosts
ecological data and although DataONE supports multiple metadata
formats, we will use the Ecological Markup Language (EML) as "the"
metadata format of DataONE. 

### Delta Smelt User Story

It's challenging to determine a specific user story for this toy
problem because the metadata records are hard to access from their
repositories.

> implement an effective metadata search. This reveals one of the many
> impediments to effectively linking metadata records from diverse
> repositories: often those repositories lack effective metadata search
> implementations in the first place, so fundamental tools like that are
> missing. 



## JSON-LD Annotations

I will serve JSON-LD representations of the metadata records. I'll do
this because we can use MongoDB to implement queries, which is more
familiar to developers. Unlike SPARQL, MongoDB is a very popular and
well-documented. I'll serve it with a Spring application, so we can
keep the whole build process within Java. I'll use Jena to build the
base RDF records that encode the linked data relationships. But some
of the extra things I can do might be to just include the whole
metadata record in the JSON-LD. I think JSON-LD can include the entire
metadata record itself.



## Web Interface

### Minimum Viable Product: Interdisciplinary Data Search

Users will be able to build interdisciplinary research projects and
automatically create data citations based on the datasets used in the
mashup. A search interface will provide linked data by the API
provided above. Future work will likely be providing user tools like
report building and automatic data bibliography management. 

For round one, we create the search interface. 

### Leave it cleaner than how you found it

It seems that these repositories have put a lot of work
into networking and formalization, but not into modern accessibility,
such as an intuitive REST API with a good user guide. Before creating
an integrated guide, it will be worthwhile to build interfaces for
both ICPSR and DataONE. 

The DataONE codebase is terrible to begin with. It would be extremely
educational for developers if there were some code and developer
documentation for the
[ONEMercury](https://cn.dataone.org/onemercury/). Although we're used
to data managers preaching that data should be open, code often is not
given the first-class sharing imperative that data is. My contention
is that such things should be open. I plan to write my own search
interface with Angular which will be hosted on GitHub.

## Work Plan

I want to use Apache Jena to build my annotations. The first step,
then, is to master a few important Java tools. I'm not going to go
with Eclipse for developing in Java, but I will use [Eclim: a
"headless" Eclipse instance]() that the user interacts with through
Vim. I want to follow [this blog post]() to set up Gradle/Eclim for
Java project management, being careful not to get too bogged down. Out
of this I just want to be able to handle dependencies efficiently and
run web apps like I do in Python. I want everything I have in my
normal Python workflow.

One of the most important things present in the two language platforms I
regularly work with is a package management system. I lately
integrated [bower]() into my [mdedit]() project to handle javascript
dependencies. Bower enhancements come at the expense of a modest learning
curve but the rewards pay of quickly. Python's [pip]() package
management system requires an even more modest investment to make use
of. In Java, I'm going with the [gradle]() package management system.
The packages I need are Apache Jena and Spring which I'll be using to
serve my JSON-LD API.
