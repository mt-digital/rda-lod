## Research Data Alliance 
### Metadata IG Fellow Project

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the code and documentation
generated for the efforts to enable researchers to find related
datasets by converting dataset metadata to [RDF](http://www.w3.org/RDF/) [Linked Open
Data](http://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/data) (see also
http://linkeddata.org/) that follows the [HCLS standard](http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/hcls/notes/hcls-dataset/).

### Building documentation

To build the .docx documentation

```
make docx
```

and

```
make pdf
```

to build the pdf version. So far there is only the one-page proposal
due before I formally begin my work with the RDA.
